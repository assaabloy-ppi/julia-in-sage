:description: Notes taken while testing asciidoc.
:source-highlighter: pygments


== Intro

Asciidoc and ascidoctor tool tested by Frans Lundberg 2021-09-22.
Inspired by the beatiful and well-organised documentation for Raspberry Pi Pico.
Possible for general use by PPISW and in particular for NFC Lock project
and "Complete Works" report.



== Conclusions

Seems really good! Easy to get started, HTML/PDF output. Code syntax highlights.
Include other files. Include data from CSV files. Include source code lines
from repo. Really cool! Seems perfect for auto-generated content.

Works really well. At least on Ubuntu (f8). How about Windows?



== Commands

To install:

    sudo apt-get install -y asciidoctor
    sudo gem install asciidoctor-pdf --pre      // For PDF support

To generate output:

    asciidoctor a.adoc
    asciidoctor-pdf a.adoc

That is it! Defaults look OK.



== On Github

Putting this file on Github.



== C language syntax highlight

Install with:

    sudo gem install pygments.rb

Then add the following line to document header.

    :source-highlighter: pygments

Some C code:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
----
