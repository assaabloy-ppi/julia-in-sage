julia-in-sage
=============

Julia Key Agreement (JKA) implemented in SageMath 9.2.
Open the worksheet (julia.ipynb) for more information.

If you do not have SageMath installed, download it from:
[www.sagemath.org](https://www.sagemath.org/).
The code is in the public domain. Use it as you wish.

If you are viewing this through the anonymous.4open.science service,
note the following. To use the julia.ipynb worksheet, you may need to copy
the source manually. Mark the text, copy, paste into a new text file, save it.
Then open it in SageMath. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Also, the PDF will not work.
